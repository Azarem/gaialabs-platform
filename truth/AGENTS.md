# AGENTS Guide - truth/

Reference outputs produced from the original C# tools. These assembly listings are used to validate the TypeScript implementation.

Files:
- `stripped.zip` – compressed codeROM used for testing and validation.
- `asm/` – generated C# output of asm code, organized by the `group` field.

The files are manually committed and not generated during normal builds.
