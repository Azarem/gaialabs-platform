## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Data & Content Storage Strategy

A successful platform requires a clear strategy for storing different types of data, balancing performance, cost, security, and version control. GaiaLabs will use a three-pillar approach:

#### 1. **GitHub Repositories**: For Project Source Code
- **What:** The user's actual modification work. Each "Project" on the platform corresponds to a Git repository.
- **Content:**
    - TSAL source code (`.ts`)
    - Custom patches (`.asm`)
    - Module configurations (`.json`)
    - Project-specific documentation
- **Why:** This is the industry standard for source code. It provides best-in-class version control, a powerful collaboration workflow (branches, pull requests, reviews), and is legally the safest approach. The stored content is transformative code, not copyrighted game assets.

#### 2. **Object Storage (Supabase Storage)**: For Binary Assets
- **What:** All binary assets associated with a project, and the base ROMs for production builds.
- **Content:**
    - User-uploaded screenshots (`.png`, `.jpg`)
    - Custom graphics (`.bin`), palettes (`.pal`), music (`.spc`)
    - Final distributable patch files (`.bps`) created by the build system.
    - Known clean base ROMs (stored privately and accessed only by the CI/CD system).
- **Why:** This approach is highly scalable, performant (via global CDN), and secure. Using **Supabase Storage** provides unified platform integration with auth and database, automatic cache invalidation, and built-in image optimization, making it ideal for a platform that will serve many assets.

#### 3. **PostgreSQL Database**: For Metadata and Relational Data
- **What:** The central "source of truth" that structures and connects all platform entities.
- **Content:**
    - User accounts, permissions, and roles.
    - Project metadata (name, description, owner, link to the GitHub repo).
    - The community-managed ROM **Databases** (the `blocks.json`, `structs.json`, etc., that define a game's structure).
    - Pointers/links to the binary assets stored in Cloudflare R2.
    - Real-time collaboration state (e.g., the current state of a tilemap being edited, which gets broadcast on change).
- **Why:** PostgreSQL is perfect for structured queries, enforcing data integrity, and its `jsonb` type is ideal for semi-structured database definitions. When combined with a provider like **Supabase**, it also becomes the engine for real-time collaboration.

##### **Database Tenancy Model: Unified Shared Database**
To support the platform's rich community features, GaiaLabs will use a **single, shared PostgreSQL database** for all games and users. A "database-per-game" or "silo" approach was rejected as it would make cross-game queries (e.g., "show all contributions by a specific user") prohibitively complex and would be an operational nightmare to maintain, back up, and scale.

Our unified model logically separates game-specific data using foreign keys. For example, a `game_database_versions` table will track specific releases of a game's structural definition (e.g., `Illusion of Gaia v1.1`), and all related data (in tables like `blocks`, `structs`, etc.) will link back to a specific version ID. This approach is highly scalable using standard PostgreSQL features like indexing and, if needed, table partitioning, while ensuring all platform data remains interconnected.

### Technology Stack
- **Core Logic (`gaia-core`)**: **TypeScript**. A new `gaia-core` package will contain a unified build engine for all ROM processing logic. This code will run directly in the browser (inside a Web Worker for responsiveness) and on the server via Node.js, ensuring 100% build parity between the "Live Preview" and "Production Build" environments. This decision prioritizes development velocity, simplicity, and maintainability for the MVP.
- **Backend API (`GaiaAPI`)**: **Node.js with TypeScript**, using a lightweight framework like Express.js or Fastify. This allows for type sharing with the frontend and is perfectly suited for its role as a fast orchestrator.
- **Frontend (`GaiaStudio`)**: **React 19 + PixiJS v8 with TypeScript**.
- **Community Platform (`GaiaCommunity`)**: **Next.js 14+**.
- **Database & Authentication**: **Supabase** for PostgreSQL with built-in real-time features and unified authentication (no NextAuth.js required).
- **Asset Storage**: **Supabase Storage**, for its global CDN, smart caching, and unified platform integration.
- **Monorepo Management**: **Turborepo**.
- **CI/CD**: **GitHub Actions**.
- **Hosting**: **Railway**, for its excellent developer experience, integrated services, and cost-effective scaling.
- **Unified Platform**: **Supabase** provides database, authentication, real-time features, and asset storage with global CDN - eliminating the need for multiple services.

#### Architectural Decision: Why Not Edge.js?
An alternative path for integrating the existing `GaiaLib` (C#) logic would be to use a bridge like `Edge.js`. This path is **strongly discouraged** for the following reasons:
- **Obsolete Technology**: The `Edge.js` project and its forks are largely unmaintained, creating a significant dependency risk.
- **Deployment Complexity**: It would require running both .NET and Node.js runtimes in the same environment, complicating deployment, breaking the simple container model, and increasing infrastructure fragility.
- **Contradicts the Vision**: It is a short-term hack that directly conflicts with the strategic goal of creating a portable, future-proof core with Rust and WebAssembly.

### ROM Build Strategy: A Dual Approach

To provide both a rapid development experience and reproducible, shareable builds, GaiaLabs will implement two distinct ROM building flows.

#### 1. The "Live Preview" Build (In-Browser)
This flow is designed for instantaneous feedback during development and occurs entirely on the user's machine.

- **Process:**
    1.  **Load Local ROM**: The user opens their project and selects their legally-owned base ROM file from their local disk. This file is loaded into the browser's memory and is **never uploaded**.
    2.  **Fetch Project Files**: The app fetches the project's source files (the "diff") from its GitHub repository.
    3.  **In-Browser Build**: The `gaia-core` library, running inside a **Web Worker** to avoid blocking the UI, takes the base ROM from memory and the project files, and "stitches" a new, patched ROM in memory. All logic, including asset processing and assembly, is handled in TypeScript.
    4.  **Instant Preview**: The resulting ROM buffer is passed directly to a browser-based SNES emulator for immediate testing.
- **Advantages**:
    - **Extremely Fast**: No network latency for builds.
    - **Secure**: Copyrighted ROM data never leaves the user's computer.
    - **Efficient**: Only the small project files are downloaded.

#### 2. The "Production" Build (via CI/CD)
This flow is used to create official, shareable patch files and is triggered by a Git push or release.

- **Process:**
    1.  **Trigger**: A user pushes to the `main` branch or creates a release tag in GitHub.
    2.  **CI/CD Pipeline**: A GitHub Actions workflow starts.
    3.  **Fetch Clean ROM**: The build environment fetches a known-clean version of the base ROM from a **private and secure Supabase Storage bucket**.
    4.  **Native Build**: The `gaia-core` library, running in a **Node.js** environment, applies the project's patches to the clean ROM.
    5.  **Generate Artifacts**: The primary output is a `.bps` patch file, not the full ROM.
    6.  **Create Release**: The `.bps` file is automatically attached to the GitHub Release, ready for public distribution.
- **Advantages**:
    - **Reproducible**: Builds are always consistent.
    - **Shareable**: Produces a legally safe patch file that anyone can use.
    - **Automated**: No manual steps required from the user.

### Asset Upload Workflow
To ensure the backend API remains fast and scalable, all binary asset uploads will use a pre-signed URL workflow, offloading the bandwidth-intensive work to the object storage service.

1.  **Request Upload**: The client informs the API it wants to upload a file.
2.  **Generate Secure URL**: The API requests a secure, temporary upload URL from Supabase Storage.
3.  **Direct Client Upload**: The client uploads the file **directly to Supabase Storage** using the provided URL. The large file never passes through the API server.
4.  **Confirm Upload**: The client notifies the API upon completion, and the API saves the file's location to the project's database record.

### Real-time Collaboration Architecture

Supabase's real-time engine enables powerful collaborative features that are essential for the GaiaLabs platform:

#### Live Editing Features
- **Tilemap Collaboration**: Multiple users can edit the same tilemap simultaneously with real-time cursor positions and change propagation
- **Sprite Editing**: Live updates when team members modify sprite frames, groups, or properties
- **Palette Synchronization**: Real-time color palette changes across all connected editors
- **Project Status Updates**: Live notifications when builds complete, errors occur, or collaborators join/leave

#### Technical Implementation
- **WebSocket Connections**: Supabase manages persistent connections for each client
- **Row Level Security**: Ensures users only see changes they're authorized to view
- **Conflict Resolution**: Operational transforms for handling simultaneous edits
- **Presence Indicators**: Show which users are currently editing specific assets

#### Collaboration Workflow
1. **User Joins Project**: Subscribe to real-time changes for project assets
2. **Edit Broadcast**: Changes are immediately sent to Supabase and propagated to other users
3. **Conflict Detection**: Automatic handling of simultaneous edits with merge strategies
4. **Change History**: All edits are logged for audit trails and rollback capabilities

## üèóÔ∏è Hosting & Infrastructure Strategy

### Primary Hosting Recommendation: Railway

**Railway** is the recommended hosting platform for GaiaLabs. It provides the ideal balance of developer experience, integrated services, cost-effectiveness, and scalability for this project's needs, and natively supports the entire recommended technology stack.

#### Why Railway is Perfect for GaiaLabs

- **Full-Stack Platform Support**: Natively supports deploying Next.js frontends, Node.js backend services, PostgreSQL databases, and Docker containers for the Rust/WASM build service.
- **Developer Experience Excellence**: Git-based deployments, automatic builds, preview deployments for every pull request, and an intuitive dashboard simplify infrastructure management.
- **Cost-Effective Scaling**: A pay-per-use model that is significantly cheaper than alternatives at scale, with no surprise bandwidth charges.
- **Integrated Tooling**: Built-in monitoring, logging, and secret management.

### Asset Storage & CDN: Supabase Storage

**Supabase Storage** is the recommended solution for all binary asset storage, providing a unified platform with excellent CDN capabilities.

- **Global CDN**: Built-in CDN with over 285 cities globally for fast asset delivery worldwide
- **Smart CDN**: Automatically invalidates cache when assets are updated or deleted (Pro plan and above)
- **S3-Compatible API**: Allows for the use of mature, well-documented S3 client libraries for managing uploads and downloads
- **Image Transformations**: Built-in image optimizer for resizing and compressing media files on the fly
- **Unified Platform**: Seamless integration with Supabase Auth and database for consistent security policies
- **Cost Effective**: Competitive pricing with no surprise bandwidth charges

### Deployment Architecture on Railway

The platform will be deployed as a series of interconnected services within a single Railway project, managed by a monorepo.

- **Services**:
    - `gaia-community`: The Next.js application.
    - `gaia-studio`: The static React + PixiJS application.
    - `gaia-docs`: The static Docusaurus site.
    - `gaia-api`: The Node.js backend API.
    - `supabase`: External PostgreSQL database with real-time features.
    - *(Optional)* `redis`: For caching or queueing if needed.
- **Builds**: GitHub Actions will be used for CI/CD, triggering deployments to Railway on pushes to the main branch. The same system will handle the "Production Build" workflow for generating `.bps` patch files.

### Database Strategy: Supabase (PostgreSQL with Real-time Features)
- **Primary Choice (Supabase)**: For projects prioritizing real-time collaboration, Supabase offers an excellent "Postgres with superpowers" solution. Its built-in real-time engine allows clients to subscribe to database changes directly, which is a massive accelerator for building collaborative features like live editor updates.
- **Key Benefits**: 
  - **Real-time Subscriptions**: Live collaboration on tilemap/sprite editing
  - **Row Level Security**: Fine-grained access control for multi-tenant projects
  - **Auto-generated APIs**: RESTful and GraphQL endpoints out of the box
  - **Unified Authentication**: OAuth providers (GitHub, Discord) with JWT tokens - **no NextAuth.js required**
  - **Edge Functions**: Server-side logic for ROM processing and Git webhooks
  - **Automatic Backups**: Point-in-time recovery and data protection
  - **Simplified Architecture**: Single platform for database, auth, real-time, and APIs

- **Extend**: Add support for new games through database contributions
- **Track**: Monitor changes and collaborate through revision systems

This roadmap provides a comprehensive path from the current multi-project architecture to a modern, unified web-based ROM editing platform that will serve the community for years to come.

### Community Management & Quality Assurance

#### Critical Concerns & Proactive Solutions

The collaboration model addresses several potential issues that could undermine platform success:

#### **1. ROM Header to IGDB Matching Challenges**

**Problem**: ROM internal names may not match external database titles, leading to failed auto-detection.

```
ROM Header: "SECRET OF MANA    " (21-byte ASCII, truncated)
IGDB Title: "Secret of Mana"
Region Variants: "Secret of Mana (USA)", "Seiken Densetsu 2 (Japan)"
```

**Solution**: Multi-stage matching with user confirmation:

```typescript
interface ROMToIGDBMatching {
  // Stage 1: Exact checksum matching (highest confidence)
  checksumMatch: (romChecksum: string) => IGDBGame | null;
  
  // Stage 2: Fuzzy title matching with region context
  fuzzyMatch: (romTitle: string, region: string) => {
    candidates: IGDBGame[];
    confidence: number;
    requiresUserConfirmation: boolean;
  };
  
  // Stage 3: User selection from candidates
  userSelection: (candidates: IGDBGame[]) => {
    selectedGame: IGDBGame;
    userFeedback: "improve-future-matching";
  };
  
  // Stage 4: Manual entry for unknown ROMs
  manualCreation: () => {
    customGame: Game;
    submitToDatabase: "community-can-improve-later";
  };
}
```

**Implementation Strategy**:
- **Checksum Database**: Maintain community-contributed ROM checksums
- **Learning System**: Machine learning from user selections
- **Fallback Gracefully**: Never block user progress due to detection issues

#### **2. Database Moderation Transition Management**

**Problem**: When databases transition from unmoderated to moderated, the change might disrupt ongoing work.

**Solution**: Simple, clear transition with advance notice:

```typescript
interface ModerationTransition {
  // Clear notification process
  advance_notice: {
    notification_period: "14-days-before-change";
    clear_messaging: "database-will-require-pull-requests-only";
    help_available: "moderators-will-help-with-transitions";
  };
  
  // Simple transition
  transition_day: {
    everyone_same_rules: "all-users-now-use-pull-requests";
    no_special_cases: "clean-simple-consistent-permissions";
    help_during_transition: "moderators-prioritize-existing-work";
  };
  
  // Post-transition support
  ongoing_support: {
    fast_review: "existing-work-gets-priority-review";
    contributor_path: "clear-way-to-become-contributor";
    moderator_help: "available-to-assist-with-workflow";
  };
}
```

#### **3. Project Lifecycle & Abandonment Prevention**

**Problem**: Valuable projects might be abandoned in private repositories, losing community benefit.

**Solution**: Activity-based lifecycle management with community takeover options:

```typescript
interface ProjectLifecycleManagement {
  // Activity monitoring
  activityTracking: {
    lastCommit: Date;
    lastLogin: Date;
    communityInterest: number; // forks, stars, issues
  };
  
  // Progressive notifications
  inactivityWarnings: {
    sixMonths: "gentle-reminder-about-project";
    twelveMonths: "offer-help-or-co-maintainer";
    eighteenMonths: "final-notice-before-community-takeover";
  };
  
  // Community takeover process
  takeoverProcess: {
    communityRequest: "users-can-request-to-adopt-project";
    ownerNotification: "final-chance-to-respond";
    transferProcess: "structured-handover-with-history-preservation";
    originalOwnerRights: "can-reclaim-within-6-months";
  };
  
  // Archival options
  archivalChoices: {
    makePublic: "release-as-public-archive";
    transferOwnership: "hand-off-to-community-member";
    permanentArchive: "read-only-preservation";
  };
}
```

#### **4. Database Quality Control Framework**

**Problem**: Incorrect database definitions could break multiple projects, undermining platform reliability.

**Solution**: Multi-layered validation and review system:

```typescript
interface DatabaseQualityFramework {
  // Automatic validation
  schemaValidation: {
    jsonSchemaChecks: "ensure-proper-structure";
    consistencyValidation: "cross-reference-integrity";
    romCompatibilityTests: "verify-against-known-roms";
  };
  
  // Community review process
  peerReview: {
    requiredReviewers: 2; // minimum for database changes
    expertReviewers: "game-specific-specialists";
    reviewCriteria: "accuracy-completeness-documentation";
  };
  
  // Testing framework
  automatedTesting: {
    romBuildTests: "ensure-projects-still-build";
    regressionTesting: "detect-breaking-changes";
    integrationTests: "verify-cross-project-compatibility";
  };
  
  // Rollback capabilities
  versionControl: {
    semanticVersioning: "major.minor.patch-for-databases";
    rollbackProcedure: "revert-to-last-known-good";
    impactAssessment: "identify-affected-projects";
  };
  
  // Quality metrics
  healthScoring: {
    completeness: "percentage-of-rom-mapped";
    accuracy: "community-validation-score";
    documentation: "quality-of-explanations";
    stability: "frequency-of-breaking-changes";
  };
}
```

#### **5. Project Discovery & Community Engagement**

**Problem**: Great projects and modules might not be discovered, reducing community engagement and collaboration.

**Solution**: Comprehensive discovery and showcase system:

```typescript
interface ProjectDiscoverySystem {
  // Content curation
  featuredContent: {
    adminCurated: "staff-picks-and-highlights";
    communityVoted: "user-rated-top-projects";
    editorsPicks: "technical-excellence-awards";
  };
  
  // Algorithmic discovery
  trendingProjects: {
    activityBased: "recent-commits-and-engagement";
    popularityMetrics: "forks-stars-downloads";
    velocityTracking: "rapidly-growing-projects";
  };
  
  // Browsing and search
  organizationalTools: {
    gameSpecificBrowsing: "filter-by-game-and-console";
    tagSystem: "user-generated-tags-and-categories";
    difficultyLevels: "beginner-intermediate-advanced";
    moduleMarketplace: "searchable-modification-catalog";
  };
  
  // Social features
  communityFeatures: {
    userProfiles: "showcase-user-contributions";
    followSystem: "follow-favorite-creators";
    collaborationBoard: "find-contributors-and-projects";
    mentorshipProgram: "pair-experienced-with-newcomers";
  };
}
```

#### **6. Enhanced ROM Detection & Metadata Management**

**Problem**: Edge cases in ROM detection could frustrate users and create duplicate entries.

**Solution**: Robust detection with comprehensive fallback strategies:

```typescript
interface EnhancedROMDetection {
  // Multi-source detection
  detectionSources: {
    internalHeader: "parse-rom-internal-metadata";
    checksumDatabase: "community-maintained-signatures";
    fileNameHeuristics: "intelligent-filename-parsing";
    userProvided: "manual-metadata-entry";
  };
  
  // Conflict resolution
  conflictHandling: {
    multipleMatches: "present-candidates-with-confidence-scores";
    noMatches: "guided-manual-entry-with-suggestions";
    contradictoryData: "community-voting-on-correct-metadata";
  };
  
  // Continuous improvement
  learningSystem: {
    userFeedback: "collect-corrections-and-confirmations";
    communityContributions: "crowdsourced-rom-database";
    machinelearning: "improve-matching-algorithms-over-time";
  };
  
  // Quality assurance
  metadataValidation: {
    crossReference: "verify-against-multiple-sources";
    communityReview: "peer-validation-of-new-entries";
    expertCuration: "specialist-review-for-rare-games";
  };
}
```

#### **7. Onboarding & User Experience Optimization**

**Problem**: Complex workflows might deter new users from contributing to the community.

**Solution**: Progressive disclosure with comprehensive support:

```typescript
interface OnboardingOptimization {
  // Guided experience
  tutorialSystem: {
    interactiveTutorials: "hands-on-project-creation-walkthrough";
    videoGuides: "embedded-instructional-content";
    progressTracking: "achievement-based-learning-path";
  };
  
  // Template system
  projectTemplates: {
    popularGames: "pre-configured-starting-points";
    commonModifications: "sprite-swaps-music-hacks-etc";
    difficultyLevels: "beginner-friendly-to-advanced";
  };
  
  // Community support
  mentorshipProgram: {
    pairNewUsers: "experienced-contributors-as-mentors";
    helpChannels: "dedicated-support-forums";
    officeHours: "scheduled-expert-availability";
  };
  
  // Documentation
  comprehensiveGuides: {
    platformOverview: "understanding-games-databases-projects";
    technicalReference: "rom-hacking-fundamentals";
    bestPractices: "community-standards-and-conventions";
  };
}
