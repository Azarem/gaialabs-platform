# AGENTS Guide - ext/GaiaLib

This directory mirrors the original C# project used as a reference when porting functionality.

## Subfolders
- `Asm/` – assembly parsing and opcode definitions.
- `Compression/` – compression providers such as `QuintetLZ`.
- `Database/` – ROM database definitions.
- `Rom/` – extraction and rebuild utilities.
- `Sprites/` – sprite processing classes.

Building the C# project requires .NET 8 and is optional. See `TSAL_Generator_Roadmap.md` for additional notes.
